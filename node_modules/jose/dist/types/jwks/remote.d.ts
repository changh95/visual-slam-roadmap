/**
 * Returns a function that resolves a JWS JOSE Header to a public key object downloaded from a
 * remote endpoint returning a JSON Web Key Set, that is, for example, an OAuth 2.0 or OIDC
 * jwks_uri. The JSON Web Key Set is fetched when no key matches the selection process but only as
 * frequently as the `cooldownDuration` option allows to prevent abuse.
 *
 * It uses the "alg" (JWS Algorithm) Header Parameter to determine the right JWK "kty" (Key Type),
 * then proceeds to match the JWK "kid" (Key ID) with one found in the JWS Header Parameters (if
 * there is one) while also respecting the JWK "use" (Public Key Use) and JWK "key_ops" (Key
 * Operations) Parameters (if they are present on the JWK).
 *
 * Only a single public key must match the selection process. As shown in the example below when
 * multiple keys get matched it is possible to opt-in to iterate over the matched keys and attempt
 * verification in an iterative manner.
 *
 * Note: The function's purpose is to resolve public keys used for verifying signatures and will not
 * work for public encryption keys.
 *
 * @param url URL to fetch the JSON Web Key Set from.
 * @param options Options for the remote JSON Web Key Set.
