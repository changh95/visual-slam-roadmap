Please note that this is a study plan for Computer Science, not web development, we have [separate roadmaps for web development](/). Also, note that this is not an exhaustive list and is a highly opinionated list of topics.

We are continuously working on improving the roadmaps. Please [create an issue with your suggestions](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/issues) or [reach out to me on twitter](https://twitter.com/kamrify) with your feedback and suggestions for improving this roadmap further.
