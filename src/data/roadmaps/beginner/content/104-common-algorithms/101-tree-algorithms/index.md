# Tree Algorithms

A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”).

Here is the list of common tree algorithms:

- Tree Traversal:
  - Pre-Order Traversal
  - In-Order Traversal
  - Post-Order Traversal
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
