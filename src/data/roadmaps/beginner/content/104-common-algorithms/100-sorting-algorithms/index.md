# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are used to sort data in a collection. Sorting is a very common task in computer science, and it is also a very common interview question. There are many different ways to sort data, and different algorithms have different advantages and disadvantages.

Learn about the sorting algorithms and know the best case/worst case, average complexity of each. Also, learn about the stability of sorting algorithms.
