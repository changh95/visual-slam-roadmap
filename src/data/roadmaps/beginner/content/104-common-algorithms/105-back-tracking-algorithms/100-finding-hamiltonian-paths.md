# Finding Hamiltonian Paths

Hamiltonian paths are paths that visit every node in a graph exactly once. They are named after the famous mathematician [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton). Hamiltonian paths are a special case of [Hamiltonian cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_cycle), which are cycles that visit every node in a graph exactly once.
