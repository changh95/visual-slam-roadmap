# Encourage Cross-Functional Knowledge

Encouraging reviewing code in unknown-areas for cross-functional knowledge not only helps the reviewer gain insights into different sections of the project but also enables the team to have a broader understanding of the system as a whole. This practice can be highly beneficial in improving code quality, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among team members.

To ensure this practice is followed, we provide you with the following tips: 
- Establish a culture where team members are encouraged to learn and are not hesitant to review code beyond their immediate circle of expertise.
- Define a clear process for code review assignments, considering reviews from diverse areas of the project.
- Schedule regular knowledge sharing sessions or training workshops to increase familiarity with different sections of the codebase.
- Use tools and automation to recommend code reviews based on individual skill levels and previous review experiences, promoting diversity in assigned projects.
- Provide constructive feedback during reviews and maintain open communication channels to facilitate knowledge sharing and discussion.
