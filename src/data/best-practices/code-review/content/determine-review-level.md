# Determine the Level of Review Needed

Determining the appropriate level of review needed based on the scope and impact of the code change is crucial to ensure a smooth and efficient code review process. This aspect is particularly important as it helps allocate resources and time effectively while still maintaining the quality and stability of the developed software. 

To make sure you determine the accurate level of review needed, consider the following tips: 

- Analyze the scope of the change: Large-scale modifications, especially those that touch multiple parts of the system, require a more thorough review compared to small, localized changes.

- Identify potential risks: Assess the code's impact on the overall system's stability and security. Critical changes affecting security or the application's core components necessitate a detailed review.

- Reflect on the developer's experience: If the code has been submitted by a less experienced developer, a deeper review is generally recommended. Conversely, trust the expertise of seasoned developers and focus primarily on their adherence to best practices.

- Evaluate test coverage: A well-tested code provides you with greater confidence in its reliability. This can lead to a lighter review since the test suite has already verified its correctness.

- Check the urgency of the change: Urgent fixes such as fixing a severe bug might warrant a quicker review, while lower priority changes can be handled with a more comprehensive analysis.

Remember, finding the right balance in the review process ensures that time and resources are used effectively while maintaining the quality of your codebase.
