# Resolve Conflicts Timely

When working on collaborative projects, conflicting opinions on various aspects of the code are unavoidable. It's crucial to resolve these differences in a timely manner to keep the development process moving forward smoothly; allowing a pull request (PR) to sit idle due to disagreement can cause unnecessary delays and foster resentment among team members. To ensure conflicting opinions are addressed promptly and constructively, consider the following tips:

- Foster Open Communication: Encourage team members to share their thoughts and opinions openly, while maintaining a respectful and supportive environment.

- Clearly Define the Criteria for Code Review: Having clear guidelines for what is expected in a code review can reduce the number of subjective opinions and help focus the discussion on relevant aspects.

- Assign a Mediator or Decision-Maker: When conflicting opinions arise, designate a trusted individual to act as a mediator, or authorize them to make a final decision after considering all viewpoints.

- Strive for Consensus: Encourage team members to actively seek consensus, emphasizing the importance of compromise and collaboration.

- Set Deadlines: Establish a reasonable timeframe for addressing disagreements and ensuring a timely resolution.

Remember, the goal of code reviews is to improve code quality and foster a positive, collaborative work environment. By addressing conflicting opinions promptly and thoughtfully, you pave the way for more efficient, effective, and harmonious development processes.
