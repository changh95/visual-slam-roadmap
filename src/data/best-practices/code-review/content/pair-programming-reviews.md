# Pair Programming Reviews

When there are a lot of changes to review, it can be difficult to keep track of everything. Pair programming is a great way to ensure that all changes are reviewed and discussed in detail. It also helps to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing between developers. In this section, we will discuss the benefits of pair programming and provide tips on how to make the most of this technique.

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two developers work together at the same computer. One developer writes the code while the other reviews each line of code as it's written, providing immediate feedback to catch issues early on. This technique can be used as an alternative or supplement to traditional code reviews. Pair programming helps to ensure code quality, reduce defects, and foster knowledge sharing between developers. To make the most of pair programming, consider the following tips: 

- Choose partners with complementary skills, so that both participants can learn from each other.
- Set clear expectations about the goals and outcomes of the pair programming session.
- Take regular breaks and swap roles between writing and reviewing code to keep both developers engaged.
- Foster open communication; encourage questions, suggestions, and discussions.
- Regularly reflect on the process and adjust as needed to ensure it remains effective and productive for both developers.
