# Prioritize Feedback

Tackling the most important issues first ensures that the developer's time is well-spent in addressing high-impact concerns, resulting in a higher quality product with fewer critical issues. As the author of this guide, I would like to share some practical tips to ensure that you prioritize your feedback effectively:

- Clearly define the goals and objectives of the code review process, so you can align your feedback with those priorities.
- Categorize your observations into 'high', 'medium', and 'low' priority, based on the impact they have on the code's performance, security, and maintainability.
- Understand the context of the code changes and the corresponding requirements, to ensure you're addressing the most relevant issues first.
- Focus on identifying and resolving design issues, performance bottlenecks, and potential security vulnerabilities before diving into stylistic or formatting concerns.
- Discuss priorities with the team and get a consensus on the order in which issues should be addressed, to ensure that everyone's input is considered in shaping the priorities.

By paying close attention to these tips, you can ensure that your code review feedback is consistently aligned with the highest-priority concerns, maximizing the value of the code review process for both yourself and your teammates.
