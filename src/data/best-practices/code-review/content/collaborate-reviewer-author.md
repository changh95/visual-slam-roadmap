# Collaborate with Author

In the code review process, it is essential to foster a collaborative environment where both the reviewer and the author work together to resolve any issues or concerns that arise. A successful review is not about pointing out mistakes or asserting authority, but rather about working together towards the common goal of improving the quality of the code. To ensure a smooth and effective collaboration, consider the following tips:

- Maintain open communication: Keep the lines of communication open and encourage a healthy discussion. Be open to receiving feedback and clarifications from the author.

- Show empathy and respect: Be considerate and respectful when providing feedback. Avoid making personal comments or using harsh language that may discourage or demotivate the author.

- Be objective and specific: When suggesting improvements, be specific and provide clear details that explain the reason for your suggestion. This will help the author understand the issue and make appropriate corrections.

- Offer possible solutions: Where possible, provide alternative solutions or recommendations that the author can consider, making it easier for them to address the issue.

- Be patient and persistent: Complex issues may require multiple iterations and extensive discussion to resolve. Stay patient and persistent, and continue to collaborate with the author until a satisfactory solution is reached.
