# Understand the Requirements and Context

In the software development process, understanding the requirements and the context of the changes being made is crucial for successful code reviews. Being aware of these aspects ensures that the reviewer can effectively evaluate how well the proposed changes meet the requirements and align with the software's overall design and purpose. It also helps in identifying potential issues and improvements that may have been overlooked. To make sure you understand the requirements and the context, consider the following tips:

- Analyze the related documentation: Review any relevant documents, such as requirement specifications or design documents, to understand the motivation behind the changes and the desired outcome.

- Communicate with the author: Don't hesitate to ask the code contributor questions or clarifications about the requirements and context, as it can help in building a mutual understanding of the changes.

- Study the issue tracker: Explore the issue tracker, if available, to get further context on the problem being addressed or the feature being implemented. This can help you understand how the proposed changes relate to the overall development goals and priorities.

- Familiarize yourself with the surrounding code: Take time to study the existing code around the changes being made, as this can provide valuable insights into the program's architecture and design philosophy.

- Consider system-wide implications: Keep in mind the broader context of how the changes might affect the system as a whole, including potential interactions with other components, performance impacts, and maintainability considerations.
