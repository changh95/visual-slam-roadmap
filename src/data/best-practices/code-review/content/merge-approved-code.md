# Merge Approved Changes

In the code review process, one essential step is merging the approved code change into the main or feature branch. This involves integrating the changes made on a separate branch or fork, which were reviewed and approved by your peers, into a single unified branch. This step not only helps maintain the stability of the codebase but also ensures a seamless collaboration amongst team members. To guarantee the success of this phase, follow the tips below:

- Always perform a test run: Before you merge, ensure that the tests pass locally and in the CI system to prevent broken builds or unexpected failures.
- Keep the main branch stable: Update your branch with the latest changes from the main branch before merging, to avoid conflicts or inconsistencies.
- Utilize Pull Requests/Merge Requests: Use collaborative features like Pull Requests in GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket to track peer reviews, comments and approvals.
- Embrace rebasing: With rebasing, you can keep your Git history cleaner and linear, avoiding unnecessary merge commits.
- Opt for a code review tool: Make use of code review tools like Gerrit or Phabricator to manage and track the review process in a structured way.
- Merge fast, merge often: Encourage smaller changes and frequent merges to avoid stagnation and complex conflict resolution.

By following these tips, you'll be able to streamline your codebase, enhance collaboration, and uphold the overall quality of your software project.
