# Set Clear Expectations for Code Review Turnaround Times

In a collaborative development environment, it is essential to establish clear expectations for code review turnaround times to ensure the smooth progression of your project. Defining reasonable timeframes for reviewing and addressing comments made during code reviews helps maintain momentum in the development process, prevents unnecessary delays, and facilitates better communication between team members. In this section, we will provide some useful tips on how to set appropriate expectations and make sure that code reviews are being conducted effectively and efficiently.

- Define a specific turnaround time: Establish a standard timeframe for team members to complete their code reviews, such as 24 hours or 48 hours depending on the complexity of the project.
 
- Set priorities: Prioritize code reviews based on the importance of the feature being developed or the urgency of the issue being addressed. Communicate these priorities to your team members to help them manage their time effectively.
 
- Track and analyze review times: Record the time taken for each code review and observe any patterns, bottlenecks, or areas for improvement. This information can help you refine your expectations and adjust your turnaround times accordingly.
 
- Encourage timely feedback: Foster a culture of prompt, valuable feedback in your team by emphasizing the importance of quick, thorough code reviews. Recognize and reward team members who consistently meet or exceed expectations when it comes to turnaround times.
 
- Be mindful of team members' workload: Consider the workload of your team members when assigning code reviews. Assign tasks accordingly to prevent overwhelming any individual or hindering the progress of the entire project.

By incorporating these tips into your development process, you will ensure that your team adheres to the expectations set for code review turnaround times and keep your project on track.
