# Verify that all changes have been Addressed

In the code review process, it is crucial to ensure that all feedback provided by reviewers has been adequately addressed by the author. This step not only helps in enhancing the quality of the code but also fosters collaboration and ensures that issues and improvements are effectively discussed and resolved. To make sure that all feedback has been addressed, follow these tips:

- Maintain a checklist: Create a list of all the feedback items received during the review process, categorizing them based on their severity or relevance.
- Take ownership: As the author, it is your responsibility to adapt to the suggestions made by reviewers, so actively participate in refining the code and making necessary changes.
- Iterative reviews: Have follow-up review sessions after implementing the suggested changes to ensure that outstanding issues have been resolved or have a legitimate reason for being left open.
- Collaborate with reviewers: Communicate with your reviewers and clarify any ambiguities or seek further guidance when working on suggested changes to ensure you fully understand the intent.
- Document decisions: Keep track of the decisions made during the review process, ensuring they are transparent and available for future reference. This will help build trust and provide valuable insights for future code reviews.

By following these steps, you can ensure that all the feedback from code review has been taken into consideration, ultimately leading to a better and more reliable codebase.
