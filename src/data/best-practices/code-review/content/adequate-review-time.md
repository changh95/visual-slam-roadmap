# Make Reviews a Priority

As the author of this guide on the best practices for code reviews, I would like to emphasize the importance of providing adequate time for code reviews and ensuring that it is a priority. Code reviews are essential to maintaining high-quality code, fostering collaboration, and sharing knowledge among team members. Therefore, it is crucial to allocate sufficient time and prioritize code reviews in your team's workflow. Here are a few tips to make sure that you're giving code reviews the attention they deserve:

- Schedule regular time slots for code reviews, either daily or on specific days of the week. This will keep code reviews on top of everyone's to-do list and encourage consistency.

- Break down large code reviews into smaller, more manageable tasks. This will help team members stay focused and motivated, resulting in more thorough reviews.

- Encourage team members to avoid multitasking while performing code reviews. This ensures that reviewers give their full attention to the code in question, reducing the likelihood of oversight.

- Set clear expectations about the timeframe for completing code reviews. Knowing that there is a deadline will motivate team members to prioritize code reviews.

- Finally, foster a culture that values code reviews, and highlight their importance at team meetings and discussions. This will ensure that everyone in the team is aligned with the priority given to code reviews.
