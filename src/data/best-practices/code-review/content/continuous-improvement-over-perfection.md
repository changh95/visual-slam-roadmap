# Seek Continuous Improvement Over Perfection

It is important to always strive for better results without getting bogged down in the pursuit of an impractical ideal. In code review, this means recognizing that not every submission will be flawless, and that even seasoned developers can have room for enhancements. The goal should be to continuously learn and improve, rather than aiming for an unattainable level of perfection. Here are some tips to help foster a mindset of continuous improvement during code review:

- Embrace a growth mindset: Understand that everyone, including yourself, can learn and grow from constructive feedback. Encourage a culture where team members feel comfortable sharing their knowledge and expertise.

- Set realistic expectations: Acknowledge that not every code submission will be perfect and that it is natural for errors and improvements to be identified during the review process.

- Encourage collaboration: Promote a culture where team members give and receive feedback willingly, supporting each other's learning and development as developers.

- Focus on incremental progress: Instead of trying to fix every single issue at once, prioritize the most impactful changes and aim for steady progress over time.

- Celebrate improvements: Recognize and celebrate the efforts made by team members in addressing feedback and making positive changes to their code.

By embracing the continuous improvement mindset, your team will be more open to feedback and motivated to learn, ultimately resulting in more efficient and higher-quality code.
