# Prepare a List

In a code review process, it's essential to ensure that all the requirements or user stories for a specific feature or bug fix have been adequately addressed in the code changes submitted for review. To achieve this, preparing a checklist of items or requirements to be covered in the changes can help streamline the review process and ensure that nothing is missed. This not only improves the overall quality of the code but also saves time and effort in potential rework. In this section, we will go over some tips on how to create a list of items that should have been covered in the changes and ensure that the code complies with them.

- Familiarize yourself with the requirements: Thoroughly analyze the project's requirements documentation or user stories and identify the key components that need to be addressed in the code changes.

- Create a checklist: Based on the requirements, create a comprehensive checklist of items that must be covered in the code changes. Break complex requirements down into smaller tasks to ensure every aspect is addressed.

- Evaluate the code changes: As you review the code, cross-check with your checklist to ensure that each item has been taken into account. If anything is missing or not up to the mark, provide specific feedback in the review comments.

- Assess test coverage: Make sure that the code changes are supported by appropriate unit or integration tests, which cover the main requirements in the checklist. High-quality tests are crucial to prevent future regressions and ensure the code fulfills its intended purpose.

- Ensure clear communication: Share your requirements checklist with the developer at the start of the code review process. This will help them understand your expectations and provide a solid foundation for a smooth and constructive review.

By creating and utilizing a requirements checklist, code reviewers can more effectively ensure that the submitted code changes adhere to the project's requirements and ultimately result in higher-quality software.
