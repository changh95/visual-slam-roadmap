# Documentation is Updated

Proper documentation serves as a guide for future developers, allowing them to easily understand, maintain and enhance the existing codebase. In addition, good documentation can also save time, mitigate confusion, and reduce errors among team members. To make sure that the relevant documentation is up-to-date and precise, follow these tips:

- Require updated documentation as part of the code review process: Make it a standard practice for developers to submit updates to the relevant documentation along with their code changes.

- Check for consistency and accuracy: Review the updated documentation to ensure it accurately and clearly reflects the changes made in the code. This includes following naming conventions, correct syntax, and descriptions of the new features or functions.

- Assess whether there are any missing sections: Look for parts of the code that may have been altered or added but have not been documented. Make sure to remind the developer to provide appropriate documentation for these changes as well.

- Encourage detailed comments in the code: Ensure that the contributors sufficiently explain their changes within the code itself. While not a strict replacement for external documentation, code comments are invaluable for understanding the intent behind the code.

- Keep documentation easy to maintain: Suggest using clear, concise language and a consistent format throughout the documentation, making it easier for team members to maintain and update as needed.

By following these tips, you will ensure that your team's documentation stays up-to-date, providing a valuable resource to support the continued quality and maintainability of your codebase.
