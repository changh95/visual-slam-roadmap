# Seek Team Members' Feedback

Seeking feedback from other team members is an essential aspect of the code review process when you are unsure about the changes made in the code. This collaborative approach not only helps in improving the quality of the code but also promotes knowledge sharing and learning among team members. To ensure that you effectively seek feedback, follow these tips:

- Don't hesitate to ask questions and present your doubts or concerns about the code changes openly.
- Reach out to team members with specific expertise in the area of the code in question to gain valuable insights.
- Use the commenting feature in your code review tool to highlight areas of the code that need clarification or further discussion.
- Encourage an open and constructive discussion around the changes, while remaining respectful and receptive to diverse opinions.
- Consider holding brief team meetings or code review sessions to discuss complex changes and ensure everyone is on the same page.

By incorporating these tips into your code review process, you will not only ensure effective feedback but also contribute to the overall improvement of your team's coding skills and products.
