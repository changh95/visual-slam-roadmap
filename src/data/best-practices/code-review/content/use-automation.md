# Use Automation

Automation can make a significant impact in code reviews. By using tools such as linters, sniffers, and other static analysis tools, you can quickly identify and fix issues before they make their way into the main codebase. This not only improves code quality but also speeds up the overall review process. To make the most of this, ensure that your development environment is set up with the right tools and configurations, allowing you to enjoy the best of both worlds: maintaining code quality standards while optimizing your review process.

Tips for leveraging automation in code reviews:

- Choose appropriate tools for your tech stack (E.g.: ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python, etc.)
- Configure the tools according to your project's coding style and conventions.
- Integrate these tools into your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, ensuring that code is automatically checked with every commit.
- Encourage developers to run linter and static analysis tools locally before pushing changes, to catch issues early on.
- Make use of automated code review platforms like SonarQube or Codacy that can help you monitor and enforce code quality standards.
- Balance automation with human review; don't solely rely on automated tools, but use them to assist and speed up the process.
