# Seek feedback Early and Often

In the software development process, it is essential for developers to use efficient and effective practices to ensure that their code is of high quality. One such practice is encouraging authors to seek feedback during the development phase, even before submitting a formal code review. This proactiveness fosters a culture of continuous learning, open communication, and shared ownership. It also helps in identifying issues early on, which greatly improves the overall health of the codebase.

To ensure that early feedback is sought and implemented, here are some tips to follow:

- Encourage developers to ask for feedback: Remind the team that everyone's opinions and expertise matter, and offer an open environment for discussions.

- Make collaboration tools accessible: Use tools and platforms that facilitate easy communication, sharing, and collaboration on code, such as Git, Slack, or code pairing sessions.

- Provide guidance and mentoring: Senior developers should take the time to guide and mentor junior developers, review code snippets, and give feedback during the development phase.

- Promote pair programming: Encourage the practice of pair programming for complex tasks, as it helps in knowledge sharing and real-time feedback.

- Regularly conduct code walkthroughs: Schedule periodic code walkthroughs or informal review sessions to ensure the team is in sync and everyone is aware of the progress.

By fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous learning, you can maximize the potential of your team and ensure that your codebase remains healthy, maintainable, and efficient.
