# Review Updated Code

In the process of conducting a code review, it is crucial to verify that the changes suggested during the review have been implemented accurately and effectively. To ensure this, you need to re-examine the updated code and check if it complies with the recommendations provided in the review. This step is not only important for maintaining the code's quality and functionality, but also for reinforcing the purpose of code review as a means of collaboration and knowledge-sharing between team members. To effectively verify the implementation of suggested changes, here are some tips:

- Keep track of the specific suggestions provided during the review. You may use a dedicated tool or document to list down and categorize each feedback and resolution.
- For each suggestion, re-visit the corresponding lines of code and assess if the changes made align with the recommendation given. Pay attention to any unintentional side effects or new issues that may have emerged due to the changes.
- Run unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure that the updated code does not break existing functionality or introduce new bugs.
- If necessary, consult with the person who made the suggestions to clarify their intentions and to verify if the implemented solution addresses their concerns.
- Be mindful of the communication between the reviewers and code authors during the review process. Make sure a collaborative environment is fostered, and constructive feedback is emphasized.

By following these tips, you can validate the successful implementation of recommended changes and help maintain a high standard for your codebase. Remember that the goal of code review is continuous improvement, and ensuring that changes are implemented as expected greatly contributes to this goal.
