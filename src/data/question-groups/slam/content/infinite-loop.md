You can use the `while` or `for` loop to create an infinite loop.

## While loop

To create an infinite loop with the `while` loop, we can use the `true` keyword as the condition.

```js
while (true) {
  // do something
}
```

## For loop

To create an infinite loop with the `for` loop, we can use the `true` keyword as the condition.

```js
for (let i = 0; true; i++) {
  // do something
}
```
